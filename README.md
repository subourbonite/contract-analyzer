# Oil & Gas Lease Contract Analyzer

A modern React application built with TypeScript for analyzing oil and gas lease contracts using AWS services.

## 🚀 Quick Start with Dev Container (Recommended)

This project includes a pre-configured development container for VS Code that provides a consistent development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies.

### Prerequisites
- VS Code with the "Remote - Containers" extension
- Docker Desktop

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for the container to build and dependencies to install

The dev container includes:
- Node.js 20, npm, TypeScript
- AWS CLI, AWS CDK, AWS Amplify CLI
- All VS Code extensions and settings pre-configured
- Automatic port forwarding for development servers

📖 See [Dev Container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in using AWS Cognito
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface supporting multiple file formats:
  - Text files (.txt)
  - Word documents (.doc, .docx)
  - PDFs (text and image-based)
  - Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- **Text Extraction**: Automated text extraction using AWS Textract
- **AI Analysis**: Contract analysis powered by AWS Bedrock
- **Data Extraction**: Automatically extracts:
  - Lessor(s) names
  - Lessee(s) names
  - Acreage details
  - Depth/formation information
  - Lease term duration
  - Royalty percentages
- **Insights Generation**: AI-powered analysis of unusual contract conditions
- **PDF Export**: Download analysis results as PDF for offline storage

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **AWS Amplify UI React** for authentication components

### Backend Services
- **AWS Cognito** for user authentication and authorization
- **AWS S3** for secure file storage
- **AWS Textract** for text extraction from documents and images
- **AWS Bedrock** with Claude 3 for contract analysis
- **AWS API Gateway** and Lambda for serverless processing

### Infrastructure
- **AWS CDK** for Infrastructure as Code
- Automated deployment to AWS Amplify

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd contract-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy AWS Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   npm install
   npm run cdk:deploy
   ```

4. **Update Amplify Configuration**
   After CDK deployment, update `src/amplifyconfiguration.json` with the outputs from the CDK stack.

5. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Deployment

#### Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm run cdk:deploy
```

#### Deploy Frontend to Amplify
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to AWS Amplify (configure hosting in AWS Console)
```

## Usage

1. **Sign In**: Create an account or sign in using the Cognito authentication
2. **Upload Contracts**: Drag and drop contract files or click to browse
3. **View Analysis**: Review extracted contract terms in an easy-to-read table format
4. **Read Insights**: Examine AI-generated insights about unusual contract conditions
5. **Export Results**: Download analysis as PDF for offline reference

## AWS Services Configuration

### Required AWS Services
- **Cognito**: User pools and identity pools configured
- **S3**: Bucket with CORS enabled for file uploads
- **Textract**: Enable document text detection and analysis
- **Bedrock**: Access to Claude 3 models (anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0)
- **IAM**: Proper roles and policies for service access

### Permissions
The application requires the following AWS permissions:
- `textract:DetectDocumentText`
- `textract:AnalyzeDocument`
- `bedrock:InvokeModel`
- `s3:GetObject`
- `s3:PutObject`

## Development

### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify Cognito configuration in `amplifyconfiguration.json`
   - Check user pool and identity pool settings

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Ensure S3 bucket CORS is properly configured
   - Verify IAM permissions for authenticated users

3. **Text Extraction Failures**
   - Check Textract service availability in your region
   - Verify file formats are supported

4. **Analysis Errors**
   - Ensure Bedrock service is enabled in your region
   - Verify access to Claude 3 models
